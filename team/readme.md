Each of the team data is written as an object. Consider using this template to add/update data:

## Template for team

```json
{
	"id": 1, // increase the id number by 1 to last id value
	"name": "Nerdfail",
	"description": "QC x Core",
	"gitUrl": "https://www.github.com/funeralfrog",
	"telegramUrl": "https://telegram.me/nerdfail",
	"imageUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65288620?v=4"
}
```

Make sure the last added key-value or object does not end with a comma
